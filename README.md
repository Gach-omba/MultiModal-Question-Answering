# MultiModal-Question-Answering
This project combines both text and images to perform queries on a database containing data in different formats
It combines transformers, Optical Character Recognition, Embedding, and a vector database( ChromaDB)

  ## PROJECT WORK FLOW
Create the vector db -> create a multimodal collection inside the database specifying the embedding function and data loader -> read the image files from your folder -> extract information from it and save it -> upload the information into the multimodal collection - > perform a query

## Getting Started
